    abstract = "With the goal of reasoning on the financial textual data, we present in this paper, a novel approach for annotating arguments, their components and relations in the transcripts of earnings conference calls (ECCs). The proposed scheme is driven from the argumentation theory at the micro-structure level of discourse. We further conduct a manual annotation study with four annotators on 136 documents. We obtained inter-annotator agreement of $lpha_{U}$ = 0.70 for argument components and $lpha$ = 0.81 for argument relations. The final created corpus, with the size of 804 documents, as well as the annotation guidelines are publicly available for researchers in the domains of computational argumentation, finance and FinNLP.",
}


The dataset covers 4 Companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft) for the period of 2015-2019. 

The original earnings transcripts was downloaded from https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/ and labeled using LabelStudio.
